# Prometeo (test) Telegram Bot 

Prometo is the largest Open Banking platform in Latam. You can read more about them here: https://prometeoapi.com/

This is a simple telegram bot to use their sandbox api but can work with the real api, at least for check account and credit cards. 

Note: Telegram calendar is not mine, i just used the [library](https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/calendar-telegram). 

You can fin the bot here: http://t.me/prometeo_test_bot

### TODO

 - [ ] Organize the functions in multiple files. Also, I should divide the User class into two or more classes.
 - [ ] Add the "All" provider, so you can check the account and credit card in all your accounts with one command.
